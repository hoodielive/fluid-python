# installing with pip
python3 -m pip install banknumber # install at system level
python3 -m pip install --user requests # install at local level
python3 -m pip list # list currently installed modules 
python3 -m pip install --upgrade requests # upgrade requests package 
python3 -m pip uninstall banknumber # uninstall banknumber
python3 -m pip help install # print out information about the pip install option 

# sift to package index and find what you need to install PyPI (if you don't know what to install to get the job done)
