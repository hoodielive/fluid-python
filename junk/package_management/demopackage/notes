Python recognizes packages 
Add metadata to a package 
Import the package 

Packages start their lives as folders on the filesystem:
  - make them as you would make any other folder
  - mkdir/create new/ctrl n 

For example:
  mkdir demopackage 
  vim demo.py
  import sys 
  print(sys.path) -> will show where python will search for packages
  import demopackage


emacs demopackage/__init__.py in order to use from all import * 
In that file place:
__all__ = ['foo', 'bar', 'baz']

Module names are variables
Imports lead to execution of code

Add module inside the package: 
the name of the file is important because its how you will import them as modules

demopackage/nsdemo
demopackage/nsdemo/foo.py
sys.path.append('foo')
sys.path.append('bar')

from nsdemo import foo, bar
